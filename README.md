# Tasks are Directories

Think about how to completely manage your to-do items.
Maybe you have some broad idea of where to look for things to do, categories
that might go by the names "work", "school", "kids", "home".

This makes for a terrible to-do list. All of your tasks are completely
unmanageable. You'll never get to cross something off. So, you take a category,
say school, and decompose. You get some sub-categories, namely one for each
class, and maybe a loose task or two, something like "course selection".

Continue this decomposition until each task can be completed in one sitting, or
has subtasks. You might get a tree like this one.

```
school
├── course_selection
├── english
│   ├── essay
│   └── worksheet
├── history
│   ├── essay
│   └── reading
└── math
    ├── homework
    │   ├── pg129
    │   └── pg133
    └── study
```

You might construct this tree by adding subtasks to each task until tasks either
have more manageable subtasks, or could be completed in one sitting.
